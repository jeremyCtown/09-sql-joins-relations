## Getting Started

The user would need to
* Create index.html
* Get the icons from IcoMoon (including all related files and CSS).
* Get the normalize.css from github.com/necolas/normalize.css.
* Search and find images of bacon, baseball, and cats
* Add filler text.
* Build CSS files according to SMACSS methodology.
* Include link to jQuery library (CDN).
* Create the articles as objects within an array with consistent property values.
* Create a constructor function to make the article array accessible to the constructor's method.
* Use jQuery to access and clone HTML elements of the DOM and populate those elements with content from the article array.
* Create forEach loops to generate new object instances and then append them to the DOM.
* Create an array of objects to hold the content generation for the DOM for each object.
* Create a JS file to generate a more interactive view of the DOM (selecting authors, catagories and hiding/showing full articles as well as navigating the long page as if it was a multipage website).
* Add Handlebars library and use it to create a tempalte for the HTML articles.
* Add the Higlight JS library and related CSS styling to have the ability to highlight content.
* Create a new HTML page to handle article submissions that offers a form to create an article and ability to preview content.
* Connect the new HTML page to the exisiting blog page and update articleView.js, as well as articles.js to render content correctly across both pages.
* Be sure to write DRY code and leverage the libraries, as well as arrow functions to make code work as optimially as possible.
* Regularly use console logs, Chrome developer console tools and the help of others to identify and correct all coding and rendering erros.
* Convert the blogArticle.js to JSON file, hackerIpsum.json
* Next the user will need to install two npm packages including Express and nodemon, fs, bodyparser, pg. 
* The user needs to be sure to create a proper .gitignore file
* Change all functions to arrow functions where possible and contextual this is not used.
* Install postgreSQL to your system.
* Create a kilovolt database.
* Write SQL queries to connect the database to the controller for use by the view.

## Architecture

We used IcoMoon icon font for navigation icons. We included the jQuery, Handlebars, Hightlight JS, and Railcasts libraies, with related CSS as needed. We installed and used Express, pg, fs and nodemon npm JS packages. We installed and used postgreSQL. We worked to create a RESTful website application. We used Chrome, and nodemon to analyze and inspect the view and the controller. We used the postgreSQL shell to check model. Project is built used HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node and SQL.
